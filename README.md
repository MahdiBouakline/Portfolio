This is my computer science portfolio. It's a collection of 10 modules that I enjoyed the most, a package of my knowledge and what I learned this quadmester. Almost all my modules are from Khan Academy, as I believe I understood them best. Enjoy!

## 1. Introduction to JavaScript ##
  
  I will continue to use this module as it is what we use to animate. HTML and CSS are wonderful tools when designing a basic website, but JavaScript goes that extra step to turn a decent website into a terrific one. My favourite part of this module was learning to add text and pictures to the screen to truly bring everything together in a satisfying manner, and one that pleases the eye.
