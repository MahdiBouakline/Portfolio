This is my computer science portfolio. It's a collection of 10 modules that I enjoyed the most, a package of my knowledge and what I learned this quadmester. Almost all my modules are from Khan Academy, as I believe I understood them best. Enjoy!

## 1. Introduction to JavaScript ##
  
I will continue to use this module as it is what we use to animate. HTML and CSS are wonderful tools when designing a basic website, but JavaScript goes that extra step to turn a decent website into a terrific one. My favourite part of this module was learning to add text and pictures to the screen to truly bring everything together in a satisfying manner, and one that pleases the eye.

## 2. Introduction to HTML/CSS ##
I will continue to use this module as it is the foundation of website design. Without HTML and CSS none of the effective websites we currently use would be accessible. My favourite part of this module was learning to create a webpage that serces a purpose from scratch. The challenges and projects were often intriguing and random. Coding a travel destination or a recipe was very satisfying when comparing where you started to the end product.
 
 
## 3. Advanced Games and Vizualtions ##
I will continue to use this module as it is essential to coding basic games and entertaining skits. This module helped me learn to create very fun mini-games, such as Tic-Tac-Toe and matching games. In terms of final product, this module was by a landslide my favourite of them all. It made me feel good about myself when I completed the games and saw what I was capable of. My favourite part of this module was learning to use loops and if statements to create those smaller games, and even incorporating characters into them. The challenges and projects were always a new game you could create and play afterwards.
 
 
## 4. Advanced JS:Natural Simulations ##
I will continue to use this module as it is very commonly used in advanced games. All proper high budget games incorporate real life mechanics, such as physics. This module helped me learn to create advanced natural scenarios and reflect them onto a canvas. It taught me to create rainfall and motions such as bounce. In terms of final product, this module was not the best result, but it's purpose was the final goal. It taught me to take games to that next level and replicate functions in our universe and how to incorporate them. My favourite part of this module was learning to use older and new variables to update the position of every object and the random function to randomize their movement. 
  
  
## 5. Computer Science Principles: programming ##
I will continue to use this module as it is essential to understanding programming and everything surrounding the subject. This module helped me understand the basics of coding, and how to use functions and more basic principles. It taught me what certain functions were used for. In terms of final product, this module didn't really have a physical one, but rather simply taught you it. The final goal was to teach the basics of coding and it fulfilled it successfully. It helped prepare me for what was to come. My favourite part of the module was taking the final tests at the end, and competing them to the quizzes at the beginning, it helped me realize how far I'd actually gotten and how much more I had to learn.   
  
  
## 6. Coding Challenge ##
This module was one of the more fun ones. I will continue to use the concept of this module, to take a basic code and splice it up. This code taught me to take something small with potential and turn it into a wonder. This project was the most enjoyable project of the course, it offered a small project with a partner, and was enjoyable team work. This project let you combine your ideasa, with that of your partner to create the best final product possible. The best part of this module was struggling to find something to add to it. I spent a long time on a call with jason tryng to figure out what we could change. Overll, this was really the only group project in the course, and it turned out to be very enjoyable.
  
  
## 7. Computer Innovation & The Internet ##
